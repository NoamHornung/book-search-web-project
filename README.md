# BookSearch Web App
## [The bookSearch web app](https://book-search-project-noam.netlify.app/)
Welcome to BookSearch Engine, a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. This application comes with a user-friendly frontend and a powerful backend, providing features such as book search, detailed book information, user accounts, and personalized book lists.

## Features:
### 1. Book Search
Users can easily search for books by entering keywords, titles, and authors. The application queries the Google Books API to retrieve relevant information and presents the user with a list of search results, that can be sorted by title, author, and release date.

### 2. Book Details
Selecting a book from the search results provides more detailed information about the selected book. Information includes the book's title, author, description, and other relevant details.

### 3. User Authentication
BookSearch offers user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and enjoy personalized features. User accounts ensure a secure and customizable experience for managing book lists.

### 4. Book Lists
Registered users can create and manage lists of their favorite books. These lists can be used to organize books based on genres, reading preferences, or any other criteria. Users can easily add or remove books from their lists.
Users can keep track of books they intend to read by adding them to a personalized watchlist. This feature helps users prioritize their reading choices and discover new books to explore in the future.
